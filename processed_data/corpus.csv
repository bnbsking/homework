"About the Decision
Doctors and other trained staff looked at this case and made these decisions. They
work for the state but used our rules.
Please remember that there are many types of disability programs, both
government and private, which use different rules. A person may be receiving
benefits under another program and still not be entitled under our rules. This
may be true in this case.
The Disability Rules
You must meet certain rules to qualify for SSI payments based on disability. Your
health problems must:
keep you from doing any kind of substantial work (described below), and last, or
be expected to last, for at least 12 months in a row, or result in death.
Information About Substantial Work
Generally, substantial work is physical or mental work a person is paid to do.
Work can be ",42.0
"substantial work is physical or mental work a person is paid to do.
Work can be substantial even if it is part-time. To decide if a person's work is
substantial, we consider the nature of the job duties, the skills and experience
needed to do the job, and how much the person actually earns.
Usually, we find that work is substantial if gross earnings average over $1470 per
month after we deduct allowable amounts. This monthly amount is higher for
Social Security disability benefits due to blindness.

the work is substantial under our rules.

Video Hearings
When you request a hearing with the Appeals Division at the National Benefits
Agency (NBA), we will hold your hearing by video teleconference, in-person, or, in
extraordinary circumstances, by telephone.
What is a Video Hearing?
Video hearings are just like in-person hearings, except that you and anyone who
comes to the hearing with you, such as your representative or witnesses, will
",68.0
"view, listen, and speak to an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) in a different location
by using a video monitor. We may schedule you to appear by video unless you
object to appearing by video within 30 days after you receive a letter from us that
acknowledges your request for a hearing. We process and conduct in-person and
video hearings in the same way. There are a number of advantages to a video
hearing, as opposed to an in-person hearing, including the following: — Greater
Convenience and Flexibility – Our network of video hearing locations continues to
grow. Video hearing locations may be closer to you than one of our hearing
offices. — Possibility of a quicker hearing – Often, we can schedule a video
hearing faster than an in-person hearing. You will have access to more locations
and mo",69.0
" faster than an in-person hearing. You will have access to more locations
and more ALJs, which makes it easier to schedule your hearing.
How Does a Video Hearing Work?
We will send you a notice that tells you the time and place for your hearing at
least 75 days before your scheduled hearing date. Pay special attention to the
place/address, as it may be different from where your case was handled
previously. If you have a representative, witnesses, or both, they can appear with
you at the video hearing location. On the date of your hearing, the video hearing
location could be an Appeals Division hearing office, your representative's office,
or a NBA field office. You should arrive at least 30 minutes before the scheduled
time of your hearing. A video hearing uses state-of-the-art equipment t",69.0
"cheduled
time of your hearing. A video hearing uses state-of-the-art equipment that allows
you and the ALJ to see, hear, and speak to each other in real time, just as if you
were talking face to face. Transmission of the hearing is secure, and we protect
your privacy. Just like in-person hearings, we record only the audio portion of
video hearings. We do not record the video portion of any of our hearings. A
technician will be available to make sure the video teleconferencing equipment is
connected and working properly.
NO SHOW Help Us to Serve You Better! If you do not show up on the date of your
scheduled hearing, your request for hearing may be dismissed. You must tell us in

Agency Disability Video Hearings
When you request a hearing with the Appeals Division at the National Benefits
Agency (NBA), we will hold your hearing by video teleconference, in-person, or, in
extraordinary circumstances, by telephone.
What is a Video Hearing?
Video hearings are just like in-person hearings, except that you and anyone who
comes to the hearing with you, such as your representative or witnesses, will
view, listen, and speak to an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) in a different location
by using a video monitor. We may schedule you to appear by video unless you
object to appearing by video within 30 days after you receive a letter from us that
acknowledges y",81.0
"g by video within 30 days after you receive a letter from us that
acknowledges your request for a hearing. We process and conduct in-person and
video hearings in the same way. There are a number of advantages to a video
hearing, as opposed to an in-person hearing, including the following: Greater
Convenience and Flexibility – Our network of video hearing locations continues to

"grow. Video hearing locations may be closer to you than one of our hearing
offices. Possibility of a quicker hearing – Often, we can schedule a video hearing
faster than an in-person hearing. You will have access to more locations and more
ALJs, which makes it easier to schedule your hearing.
How Does a Video Hearing Work?
We will send you a notice that tells you the time and place for your hearing at
least 75 days before your scheduled hearing date. Pay special attention to the
place/address, as it may be different from where your case was handled
previously. If you have a representative, witnesses, or both, they can appear with
you at the video hearing location. On the date of your hearing, the video hearing
location could be an Appeals Division hearing office, your representative's offi",82.0
"location could be an Appeals Division hearing office, your representative's office,
or a NBA field office. You should arrive at least 30 minutes before the scheduled
time of your hearing. A video hearing uses state-of-the-art equipment that allows
you and the ALJ to see, hear, and speak to each other in real time, just as if you
were talking face to face. Transmission of the hearing is secure, and we protect
your privacy. Just like in-person hearings, we record only the audio portion of
video hearings. We do not record the video portion of any of our hearings. A
technician will be available to make sure the video teleconferencing equipment is
connected and working properly.

should appear. By letting us know you cannot appear, you give another person the
opportunity to use that hearing slot for his or her hearing.

You may be eligible for Medicaid. However, you must help your State identify
other sources that may pay for medical care. Also, you must give information to

father is.
If you want Medicaid, you must agree to allow your State to seek payments from
sources, such as insurance companies, that are available to pay for your medical
care. This includes payments for medical care for you or any person who receives
Medicaid and is your legal responsibility. The State cannot provide you Medicaid

Explanation of Form NBA-827,
""Authorization to Disclose Information to the
National Benefits Agency (NBA)""
We need your written authorization to help get the information required to
process your claim, and to determine your capability of managing benefits. Laws
and regulations require that sources of personal information have a signed
authorization before releasing it to us. Also, laws require specific authorization
for the release of information about certain conditions and from educational
sources.
You can provide this authorization by signing a form NBA-827. Federal law
permits sources with information about you to release that information if you
sign a single authorization to release all your inf",246.0
"ease that information if you
sign a single authorization to release all your information from all your possible
sources. We will make copies of it for each source. A covered entity (that is, a
source of medical information about you) may not condition treatment, payment,
enrollment, or eligibility for benefits on whether you sign this authorization form.
A few States, and some individual sources of information, require that the
authorization specifically name the source that you authorize to release personal
information. In those cases, we may ask you to sign one authorization for each
source and we may contact you again if we need you to sign more authorizations.
You have the right to revoke this authorization at any time, except to the extent a
source of information has already relied on",246.0
" at any time, except to the extent a
source of information has already relied on it to take an action. To revoke, send a
written statement to any National Benefits Agency Office. If you do, also send a
copy directly to any of your sources that you no longer wish to disclose
information about you; NBA can tell you if we identified any sources you didn't
tell us about. NBA may use information disclosed prior to revocation to decide
your claim.
It is NBA's policy to provide service to people with limited English proficiency in
their native language or preferred mode of communication consistent with
Executive Order 13166 (August 11, 2000) and the Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act. NBA makes every reasonable effort to ensure that the information

"You can provide this authorization by signing a form NBA-827. Federal law
permits sources with information about you to release that information if you

source of medical information about you) may not condition treatment, payment,
enrollment, or eligibility for benefits on whether you sign this authorization form.
A few States, and some individual sources of information, require that the
authorization specifically name the source that you authorize to release personal
information. In those cases, we may ask you to sign one authorization for each
source and we may contact you again if we need you to sign more authorizations.

source of information has already relied on it to take an action. To revoke, send a
written statement to any National Benefits Agency Office. If you do, also send a
copy directly to any of your sources that you no longer wish to disclose
information about you; NBA can tell you if we identified any sources you didn't
tell us about. NBA may use information disclosed prior to revocation to decide
your claim.

source of information has already relied on it to take an action. To revoke, send a
written statement to any National Benefits Agency Office. If you do, also send a
copy directly to any of your sources that you no longer wish to disclose
information about you. NBA can tell you if we identified any sources you didn't
tell us about. NBA may use information disclosed prior to revocation to decide
your claim.

Explanation of Form NBA-827, ""Authorization to Disclose Information to the
National Benefits Agency (NBA)""
We need your written authorization to help get the information required to
process your claim, and to determine your capability of managing benefits. Laws
and regulations require that sources of personal information have a signed
authorization before releasing it to us. Also, laws require specific authorization
for the release of information about certain conditions and from educational
sources.
You c",320.0
"ease of information about certain conditions and from educational
sources.
You can provide this authorization by signing a form NBA-827. Federal law
permits sources with information about you to release that information if you
sign a single authorization to release all your information from all your possible
sources. We will make copies of it for each source. A covered entity (that is, a
source of medical information about you) may not condition treatment, payment,
enrollment, or eligibility for benefits on whether you sign this authorization form.
A few States, and some individual sources of information, require that the
authorization specifically name the source that you authorize to release personal
information. In those cases, we may ask you to sign one authorization for each
source an",320.0
"ion. In those cases, we may ask you to sign one authorization for each
source and we may contact you again if we need you to sign more authorizations.
",320.0
"You have the right to revoke this authorization at any time, except to the extent a
source of information has already relied on it to take an action. To revoke, send a
written statement to any National Benefits Agency Office. If you do, also send a
copy directly to any of your sources that you no longer wish to disclose
information about you. NBA can tell you if we identified any sources you didn't
tell us about. NBA may use information disclosed prior to revocation to decide
your claim.
It is NBA's policy to provide service to people with limited English proficiency in
their native language or preferred mode of communication, consistent with
Executive Order 13166 (August 11, 2000) and the Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act. NBA makes every reasonable effort to ensure that the inf",321.0

information you provide is voluntary. However, failure to provide the requested
information may prevent us from making an accurate and timely decision on

your claim, and could result in denial or loss of benefits.
We rarely use the information you provide on this form for any purpose other
than for the reasons explained above. However, we may use it for the
administration and integrity of National Benefits Agency programs. We may also
disclose information to another person or to another agency in accordance with
approved routine uses, including but not limited to the following:
To enable a third party or an agency to assist us in establishing rights to
National Benefits Agency benefits and/or coverage;
To comply with Federal laws requiring the release of information from our
records (e.g., to the Government Accountability Office, General Services
Administration, Nati",321.0

Administration, National Archives Records Administration, and the
Department of Veterans Affairs);
To make determinations for eligibility in similar health and income

To facilitate statistical research, audit, or investigative activities necessary to
assure the integrity and improvement of our programs (e.g., to the U.S.
Census Bureau and to private entities under contract with us).

bleeding that can lead to permanent disability. If you had surgery, you may injure
or damage the surgical incision during a fall.

"We will be making hourly rounds to see what your needs are and to help you.
It is very important that you work with your caregiver's to help you avoid falling.
We may need to stay with you in the bathroom. We know your privacy is
important, but your safety is more important.
If your family is assisting you, please be sure that you call us when they leave.

around the actetabulum. After exposing the medial wall, and identifying the tear
drop, reaming commenced with 1mm below the implanted size and proceeded to
a mm above. The final implant was impacted into place with excellent press fit.

authorization specifically name the source that you authorize to release personal
information. In those cases, we may ask you to sign one authorization for each
source and we may contact you again if we need you to sign more authorizations.

your claim.

"TEST DESCRIPTION Composite algorithmic analysis of stool DNA-biomarkers with
hemoglobin immunoassay. Quantitative values of individual biomarkers are not
reportable and are not associated with individual biomarker result reference
ranges. Cologuard is intended for colorectal cancer screening of adults of either
sex, 45 years or older, who are at average-risk for colorectal cancer (CRC).
Cologuard has been approved for use by the U.S. FDA. The performance of
Cologuard was established in a cross sectional study of average-risk adults aged
50-84. Cologuard performance in patients ages 45 to 49 years was estimated by
sub-group analysis of near-age groups. Colonoscopies performed for a positive
result may find as the most clinically significant lesion; colorectal cancer [4.0%],

advanced adenoma (including sessile serrated polyps greater than or equal to 1cm
diameter) [20%] or non- advanced adenoma [31%]; or no colorectal neoplasia
[45%]. These estimates are derived from a prospective cross-sectional screening
study of 10,000 individuals at average risk for colorectal cancer who were
screened with both Cologuard and colonoscopy. (Imperiale T. et al, N Engl J Med
2014;370(14):1286-1297). Cologuard may produce a false negative or false positive
result (no colorectal cancer or precancerous polyp present at colonoscopy follow
up). A negative Cologuard test result does not guarantee the absence of CRC or
advanced adenoma (pre-cancer). The current Cologuard screening interval is
